## Motivation / Project Criteria

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data, I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain security criteria SO THAT I can create a strong password to provide greater security.

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
[x] THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
[x] THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
[x] THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
[x] THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
[x] THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
[x] THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
[x] THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page


## Approach

This project utilizes Javascript functions to generate the desired characters in an array as a more secure password, and then easily copy to clipboard.


## Technology Used

Javascript and a pre-generated CSS and HTML 5.
